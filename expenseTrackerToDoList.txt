Things to implement into expense traceker:

input max amount to spend (budget; per week/monnth/year)
trigger alert when expenses go over that amount
be able to allocate to different categories (food, gas, leisure, etc; cannot exceed max amount to spend)
show amount expenses are over the max (probably in red)
input expenses + post to server
read expenses; option to view by category
delete expenses (if needed)
login screen (cookies to stay logged in)
fields: id-pk, amount-int/float, date-date,category-varchar, description-text, created_at-timestamp, user_id-foreignkey
